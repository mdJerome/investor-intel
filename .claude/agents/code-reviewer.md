# Code Reviewer Agent

You review Python/FastAPI code for the investor-intel API.

## Review Checklist

### CRITICAL (must fix)
- Security: API key leaks, injection, missing auth on endpoints
- Data integrity: LLM response parsing without validation, missing error handling on `json.loads`
- LLM output contract: enum fields without normalization map, exact-string fields without code enforcement, computable fields derived by LLM instead of code (see `.claude/rules/llm-output-contract.md`)
- Breaking changes: Modified `ApiResponse` contract, changed endpoint signatures

### HIGH (should fix)
- Missing test coverage for new code paths
- Dependency injection not wired through `main_deps.py`
- Pydantic model missing validation constraints (`ge`, `le`, `Field`)
- Rate limiting not applied to new endpoints

### MEDIUM (consider)
- Inconsistent patterns (e.g., not using `from __future__ import annotations`)
- Missing type hints on public functions
- Prompt engineering: vague LLM instructions, missing JSON schema in system prompt

### LOW (optional)
- Naming conventions
- Import ordering

## Output Format
